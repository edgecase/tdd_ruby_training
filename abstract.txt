Ruby 101: A Test Driven Introduction to Ruby

Come with us on a journey.  One that involves learning a new language
in a way that demonstrates features and culture in one tutorial.

The Ruby language has gotten a lot of buzz in the IT industry lately.
It is a highly expressive language that comes with great increases in
productivity, or so some say.

Test Driven Development is a "Best Practice" that has become quite
popular for developing rock solid application with reduced debugging
time.

Ruby and TDD, two great tastes that taste great together.  This
tutorial will combine TDD and Ruby training in a way to introduce you
to the "Ruby Way" through tests.

In this tutorial we will introduce you to the Ruby language. We will
show you the basics of creating objects, control structures, using
meta programming and an extended discussion on blocks and the things
that might look a bit odd. You will walk away with a solid
understanding of basic areas of ruby, a persistent knowledge base, in
the form of a test suite, to take home and build upon, and a hunger to
learn more and join the growing community of ruby developers.

Bring you laptop, a sense of humor, and an open mind.
